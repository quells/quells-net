			<h2>How do Halogen Light Bulbs Work?</h2>
			
			<div class="floatright"><img src="images/halo.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Halogen" /></div>
			
			<p>In a halogen light bulb, electricity is run through a wire – called the filament, and usually made of tungsten for durability – which heats up due to its electrical resistance. This excites the atoms in the filament, causing their electrons to reach higher energy orbits. As the wire cools down, the atoms become les excited and the electrons try to go back to their normal orbits. This requires giving off energy, however, which is done in the form of emitting photons – light. This all happens in an instant and is multiplied by the billions of atoms in the filament, which produces the bright light we see.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This process is very similar to the one used in incandescent bulbs, but with a key difference. A very small amount of a halogen gas – usually iodine or bromine – is also put in the bulb, which doubles the life of the filament. Also, they generally are more efficient, using only one-tenth of the power of an incandescent bulb. However, they generally create less light than a normal bulb, so more must be used to light the same area.</p><br><br>
