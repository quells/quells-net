			<h2>How do Incandescent Light Bulbs Work?</h2>
			
			<div class="floatright"><img src="images/lightbulb-mini.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Incandescent" /></div>
			
			<p>In a traditional light bulb, electricity is run through a wire – called the filament, and usually made of tungsten for durability – which heats up due to its electrical resistance. This excites the atoms in the filament, causing their electrons to reach higher energy orbits. As the wire cools down, the atoms become less excited and the electrons try to go back to their normal orbits. This requires giving off energy, however, which is done in the form of emitting photons – light. This all happens in an instant and is multiplied by the billions of atoms in the filament, which produces the bright light we see.<p/>
			<br>
			<p>This is not a very efficient process however – usually less than 5% – as most of the light produced is in the infrared spectrum, which is invisible to humans. Also, heating the filament to such high temperatures actually evaporates it, which shortens the lifespan of the bulb. That’s why burnt out light bulbs have black spots – that’s actually the tungsten that has condensed on the inside of the bulb. To combat this, light bulbs today are often made with a slight vacuum inside the bulb so that the filament does not evaporate as quickly, but incandescent light bulbs still only have a lifespan of about 1200 hours.</p><br><br>
