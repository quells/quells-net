			<h2>How do Compact Fluorescent Bulbs Work?</h2>
			
			<div class="floatright"><img src="http://assets.quells.net/DP/proj/lightbulbs/images/cfl.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Compact Fluorescent" /></div>
			
			<p>In a compact fluorescent light bulb, electricity is run through mercury vapor, which excites its atoms. This in turn excites the atoms of a phosphorous gas, causing its electrons to reach higher energy orbits. As the gas cools down, the atoms become less excited and the electrons try to go back to their normal orbits. This requires giving off energy, however, which is done in the form of emitting photons – light. This all happens in an instant and is multiplied by the billions of atoms in the gas, which produces the bright light that we see.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This is a much more efficient process than the one employed by incandescent bulbs, however there is some concern over the fact that fluorescent lights use mercury to function. When the lights are thrown away, the mercury – a neurotoxin – escapes into the environment, which causes problems later. Manufacturers have made great strides in reducing the mercury present in the bulbs, though, some by as much 70%. Also, they last upwards of ten times longer than incandescent bulbs.</p><br><br>
