			<h2>Info</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>Genetic transformation is the process of inserting a relatively short sequence of circular DNA called a plasmid into a bacteria so that the bacteria can be used to produce a protein. The bacteria is then killed so that the protein can be extracted easily.</p>
			<p>To practice this, we inserted the plasmid pGLO into a non-pathogenic strain of E. Coli in order to produce the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The pGLO plasmid contains genes for plasmid reproduction, ampicillin (an effective antibiotic derived from penicillin) resistance, and GFP production. There is also a gene just before the GFP production gene that has an arabinose (a kind of sugar) activated operon attached to it. This gene acts as a switch, only allowing GFP production when arabinose is present in the bacteria's environment.</p>
			<p>To learn about the biopharmaceutical industry, we also set up &quot;companies&quot; that competed to bring GFP &quot;to the market.&quot; Each member of our group had a unique role: CEO, CFO, COO, Director of R&amp;D, Safety Officer, and Attorney. I played the role of COO, or Chief Operations Officer, and had to make sure that everything was done properly.</p>
