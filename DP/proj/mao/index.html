				<h2>Birth and Eary Life</h2>
				<span class="date">December 26, 1893 &mdash; 1911</span>
				<p>Mao Zedong was born into a relatively wealthy peasant family towards the end of the nineteenth century. Because of this, he was well educated and eventually attended Peking University. This is where he first encountered Marxism, and was quickly seduced by it. However, the Chinese Revolution of 1911 interrupted his university days, as he served in the revolutionary army against the Imperial forces.</p>

				<h2>The Xinhai Revolution</h2>
				<span class="date">October 10, 1911 &mdash; January 1, 1912</span>
				<p>Often referred to as the 1911 Revolution or the Chinese Revolution, this was when the old pattern of supreme power belonging to an Emperor and his court officially crumbled. For many years, the Qing Dynasty that ruled during that time had experienced many debilitating conditions, both from within and without the government. They suffered from less-than-satisfactory emperors, an ineffective military, and rampant government corruption. They were forced to battle foreigners with superior technology and weaponry, both for land and trade. It was a near-perfect situation for an internal coup and that&rsquo;s just what the revolutionary army accomplished, replacing the Imperialist government with a Nationalist republic.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="CCP" class="item">
				<h2>The Chinese Communist Party</h2>
				<span class="date">1921</span>
				<p>Inspired by the May Fourth Movement in 1919, as well as the success of the Russian Revolution just a few years prior, Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao founded the Communist Party of China in Shanghai in July of 1921. Among the first members were Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Lin Biao &mdash; some of whom would play important roles in the years to come. Though they used Marxism as a starting point, they made one important alteration: they targeted the farmers. They were much more numerous than their urban industrial counterparts, and had much more to fight for. However, the CCP wouldn&rsquo;t come into power for a few more decades; the Nationalists, who favored industrial workers and rich merchants, were still in power.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Chiang Kai-Shek Takes Over</h2>
				<span class="date">1925</span>
				<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, the leader of the Nationalist Party, Sun Yat-sen, became the leader of China, but quickly left this post. His successor attempted to create a new Imperial government, however, and was quickly overthrown. He returned to power after a few years before meeting his untimely demise in 1925. After a brief power struggle, a man by the name of Chiang Kai-Shek emerged as the new leader of the Nationalist Party, set to instate some reform. At about this time, Mao was an organizer for both the Nationalists and Communists working in Shanghai &mdash; a dangerous place to be for a Communist for the next few years. Among the reforms that Chiang Kai-Shek brought to the government was the eradication of all Communists, which ultimately led to the Long March.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="march" class="item">
				<h2>The Long March</h2>
				<span class="date">October 1934 &mdash; October 1936</span>
				<p>Under pressure from the Nationalists, Mao Zedong led over one hundred thousand Communists and their families over six thousand miles through some of the toughest terrain in China. Along the way they indoctrinated farmers and convinced many to continue with them on their journey to northern China. Even so, less than thirty thousand survived the trek, which greatly damaged the Communist Party. They were now in a remote region of China, however, outside the influence of the Nationalists where they could build up a strong army. And so, the Communists and the Nationalists were locked in a stalemate. All that would change, however, when the Japanese invaded.</p>

				<h2>The Second Sino-Japanese War</h2>
				<span class="date">July 7, 1937 &mdash; September 9, 1945</span>
				<p>For decades, ambitious Japanese generals had dreamt of conquering China and utilizing their abundance of natural resources. As a small island nation, however, they never had the military might to do so &mdash; until the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the Qing Dynasty had given away small plots of coastal land to foreigners, mostly traders from Europe. After World War I, the Allied powers essentially gave all of Germany&rsquo;s land in China to Japan for their assistance in the war effort. This gave Japan the foothold that it needed to begin preparations for an all-out war, which wouldn&rsquo;t erupt for several years. When it did, however, the Nationalists begged the Communists to assist them in defending their country, and they gladly assisted the effort. After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States also aided the expulsion of Japanese forces and the conflict was lumped into World War II. The Japanese surrender in WWII was also the conclusion to the Sino-Japanese War, and China regained much of its land.</p>

			<div id="PRC" class="item">
				<h2>The People&#x27;s Republic of China</h2>
				<span class="date">October 1, 1949</span>
				<p>Immediately after WWII ended, China again erupted into civil war between the Communists and the Nationalists. Under Mao&rsquo;s orders, Communist forces pushed the Nationalists southeast through all of China until eventually they retreated to the island of Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-Shek established the Republic of China. Soon after this, Mao Zedong announced the establishment of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China &mdash; the &lsquo;people&rsquo;s&rsquo; added to both differentiate itself from the Nationalists as well as to indicate that it was a communist state and worked &lsquo;for the people&rsquo;. Although the actual fighting had ended both parties still fired at each other from time to time, though most of it was merely propaganda-filled shells to incite members of the other country to swap alliances.</p>

				<h2>The Great Leap Forward</h2>
				<span class="date">1953 &mdash; 1953</span>
				<p>During Mao&rsquo;s time as Chairman of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, he had a series of &lsquo;five-year-plans&rsquo; to elicit change throughout China. These were used to gradually make radical changes, as well as to provide an approachable timeline for those who would actually be carrying out these tasks. One of the most famous of these plans was dubbed the Great Leap Forward, though it was perhaps anything but. The plan was brought about to increase China&rsquo;s industrial prowess, and ultimately to make it a world power. To do this, the government ordered farmers to move to &lsquo;communes&rsquo; of up to seventy-five thousand other farmers, so that they could turn farming almost into an assembly-line-like operation. Supposedly it was going to be beneficial for all, as the peasants would have a collective store of food to share instead of some having surpluses and others not having enough to eat. At the same time, steel production was initiated throughout the country &mdash; even within these communes. So intensely was the emphasis put on the production of steel that farmers began working in the furnaces instead of harvesting their crops. This led to a massive famine, starving at least twenty million Chinese peasants: twice the number that perished in the Holocaust. While all of this was happening, local officials were lying about how much food they were actually producing to look good to their superiors, and sent off as much food as they could to make their quotas. This led to an even greater lack of food, and only exacerbated the famine. In the end, the Great Leap Forward was more like a Great Leap Backwards, and greatly diminished Mao&rsquo;s standing with the people &mdash; so much so that he retired from Chairman.</p>

				<h2>The Cultural Revolution</h2>
				<span class="date">1966 &mdash; 1968</span>
				<p>Mao&rsquo;s successors, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, were much more moderate Communists and took an approach to progress that was too slow for Mao&rsquo;s taste. Mao still commanded the hearts of millions, and he used this to his advantage. He called upon his supporters to question the authority of their superiors to find any unorthodoxy, any nonconformance, and to report it. He especially attacked &lsquo;elitists&rsquo;, who were intellectuals and bureaucrats who lived in the cities. They even imprisoned Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and put Lin Biao &mdash; one of the founding members along with Mao &mdash; in power. He wrote a series of essays that outlined what it was to be a good Chinese communist, and these were combined into what became his Little Red Book &mdash; which virtually everyone was required to carry with them at all times. In September of 1966, millions of students and young workers who called themselves the Red Guards assembled in Tiananmen Square to see Mao Zedong, and he was worshipped like a god. He told them to go out into China and destroy what he called the Four Olds: old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. What ensued was some of the most widespread destruction of ancient crafts that the world has ever seen. Additionally, youths who lived in the city were required to move to the countryside, to be educated in the hardships of the average man in China. The youths that lived in the countryside were also transplanted to the cities, where they received a rudimentary education in the accomplishments of the Chinese Communist Party. As a result this period, there is now an entire generation who never received a proper education, which ultimately hurt China&rsquo;s economy.</p>

				<h2>Death</h2>
				<span class="date">September 9, 1976</span>
				<p>Mao&rsquo;s health had been declining for several years prior to his death, and had had three heart attacks. The last had hospitalized him in early September of 1976, and he died a little after midnight on September 9. The country went into deep mourning, and a memorial service was held in Tiananmen Square a week after his death. As a result of his death, Deng Xiaoping was released from captivity and assumed the role of president. He openly condemned the Gang of Four, high-ranking officials who had fiercely supported Mao&rsquo;s ideas after his resignation from Chairman, as well as the Cultural Revolution. Today, all Chinese still publically revere him, though many remember the harsh years during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.</p>
